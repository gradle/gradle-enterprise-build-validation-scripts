In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Gradle Enterprise's local build caching functionality when running the build
from different locations. A build is considered fully cacheable if it can be
invoked twice in a row with build caching enabled and, during the second
invocation, all cacheable goals avoid performing any work because:

  * The cacheable goals’ inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The cacheable goals’ outputs are present in the local build cache and
  * No cacheable goals were excluded from build caching to ensure correctness

The experiment will reveal goals with volatile inputs, for example goals that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal goals that produce
non-deterministic outputs consumed by cacheable goals downstream, for example
goals generating code with non-deterministic method ordering or goals producing
artifacts that include timestamps. In addition, the experiment will reveal
goals that contain an absolute file path in one of their inputs.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those goals whose outputs are
not taken from the local build cache due to changed inputs or to ensure
correctness of the build, to then make an informed decision which of those
goals are worth improving to make your build faster, to then investigate why
they are not taken from the local build cache, and to finally fix them once you
understand the root cause.

The experiment can be run on any developer’s machine. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Enable only local build caching and use an empty local build cache
  2. Run the build with a typical goal invocation including the ‘clean’ goal
  3. Run the build from a different location with the same goal invocation including the ‘clean’ goal
  4. Determine which cacheable goals are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed, cacheable goals are worth improving
  6. Fix identified goals

The script you have invoked automates the execution of step 1, step 2, and step 3
without modifying the project. Build scans support your investigation in step 4
and step 5.

After improving the build to make it better leverage the local build cache,
you can push your changes and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle
of run → measure → improve → run.

empty local build cache will be used.

The ‘Summary’ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The build
scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where you can
inspect what goals were not leveraging the local build cache.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what goals were avoided due to
local build caching and what goals executed in the second build, which of those
goals had the biggest impact on build performance, and what caused those goals
to not be taken from the local build cache.
